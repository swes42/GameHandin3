Noell - Added more boulders, trees, and Selina's player person because I was curious. I didn't quite get as far with the map as I wanted to and I have to get better at placing the things more naturally instead of just grouping them together. It takes me a long time because I try to make the trees and boulders individual sizes? There has to be a better way to do that. 
I fiddled around more with Selina's player now and I ended up also deleting the main camera in my scene so I could see him move around. He's quite interesting haha.


Selina - Worked on a player character and health bar but didn't quite finish it. I pushed it anyway. The player also has a script attached. The player can walk around. If I had more time I would have liked to finish the health bar and polish up the conditions for the animations so that they fit better. Players sure are an interesting topic because there are so many aspects that you have to make sure works well together. 

Malthe - Added NPC with idle, walk and run animations along with a script that simply tells the NPC to follow the player. I'm currently facing some issues with the correct animation not being "played" once the NPC reaches the corresponding movement speeds. So at the moment the NPC just slides around in his idle animation. This feels like an issue I've fixed before, but I cannot remember how. Either way I still feel like I learned something new and had fun playing around with it.
